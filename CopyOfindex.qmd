# Welcome to my new webpage.

**Sorry I am not taking graduate students until Fall 2026**

## The work we do in the laboratory covers two broad areas of research

1.  Bigeochemistry of streams, lakes, and tile-drained agricultural fields

-   Watershed management effects on stream water quality

-   Nitrate removal of constructed wetlands

-   Cover crop reduction of nitrate losses

-   Monitoring water quality in streams entering two drinking water reservoirs

2.  Crayfish ecology and invasions

-   Invasion dynamics in streams

-   Performance and behavior in flow

-   Morphological differences in response to flow

My laboratory is currently working on one primary project:

1.  Role of cover crops in reducing nutrient loss from a new experimental plot system using a new cash cover crop.The aspects of this project we will be working on are:

-   Soil quality and nutrient content

-   porewater nitrogen concentrations with and without cover crops

-   weed diversity and biomass associated with cover crops compared to reference

-   honeybee use of the cover crop

-   nutrient loss from tile water

still updating and seeing if I can fix the navbar
