## Personal Background

I am an aquatic ecologist specializing in the chemistry and biology of freshwater ecosystems. My journey into aquatic ecology began with a fascination for understanding how natural and human-modified systems interact to shape water quality and ecosystem health.

## Educational Background

My academic training provided a strong foundation in both ecological theory and practical field research methods. This combination allows me to tackle complex environmental questions that require both rigorous scientific approaches and real-world applications.

## Teaching & Mentorship

At Illinois State University, I am passionate about training the next generation of environmental scientists. I teach courses that bridge fundamental ecological principles with hands-on research experience, helping students develop both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in:

- Aquatic ecology and limnology
- Biostatistics and data analysis  
- Field research methods
- Environmental problem-solving

## Research Philosophy

My approach to research emphasizes the importance of long-term studies and collaborative partnerships. I believe that effective environmental science requires working closely with land managers, policymakers, and local communities to develop solutions that are both scientifically sound and practically implementable.
