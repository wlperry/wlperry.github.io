## Personal Background

I am an aquatic ecologist specializing in the chemistry and biology of freshwater ecosystems. My journey into aquatic ecology began with a fascination for understanding how natural and human-modified systems interact to shape water quality and ecosystem health.

## Current Position

I am currently a faculty member in the Department of Biology at the University of Minnesota Duluth, where I conduct research on freshwater ecosystems in the Lake Superior region and broader upper Midwest.

## Research Interests

My research integrates biogeochemical processes with ecological dynamics to understand how human activities affect water quality and aquatic communities. I specialize in:

-   **Freshwater Biogeochemistry**: Nutrient cycling, water quality assessment, and ecosystem function
-   **Invasion Ecology**: Species introductions, community dynamics, and ecosystem impacts\
-   **Applied Ecology**: Watershed management, agricultural best practices, and conservation strategies
-   **Field Research Methods**: Long-term monitoring, experimental design, and statistical analysis

## Teaching & Mentorship

At UMD, I am passionate about training the next generation of environmental scientists. I teach courses that bridge fundamental ecological principles with hands-on research experience, including biostatistics and data analysis methods that are essential for modern ecological research.
