####The work we do in the laboratory covers two broad areas of research

1. Bigeochemistry of streams and lakes    
    - Watershed management effects on stream water quality    
    - Constructed wetland nitrate removal potential    
    - Cover crop reduction of nitrate losses    
    - Monitoring water quality in streams entering two drinking water reservoirs    
      
2. Crayfish ecology and invsions    
    - Invasion dynamics in streams
    - Performance and Behavior in flow
    - Morphological differences in response to flow
