## Research Overview

Our laboratory focuses on two interconnected areas of freshwater ecology research that address critical environmental challenges facing aquatic ecosystems today.

### 1. Biogeochemistry of Freshwater Systems

We investigate the complex chemical and biological processes that govern water quality in streams, lakes, and tile-drained agricultural landscapes. Our current research includes:

- **Watershed Management & Water Quality**: Assessing how land management practices influence downstream water chemistry and ecosystem health
- **Constructed Wetland Performance**: Evaluating the effectiveness of engineered wetlands for nitrate removal from agricultural runoff  
- **Cover Crop Efficacy**: Quantifying how cover crops reduce nutrient losses from agricultural fields
- **Reservoir Water Quality Monitoring**: Long-term monitoring of water quality in streams feeding drinking water reservoirs

### 2. Crayfish Ecology & Invasion Biology

Our crayfish research examines how native and invasive species interact with their environment and each other:

- **Stream Invasion Dynamics**: Understanding how invasive crayfish species colonize and establish in new watersheds
- **Flow Performance & Behavior**: Investigating how water flow affects crayfish movement, feeding, and survival
- **Morphological Adaptations**: Documenting physical changes in crayfish populations in response to different flow regimes
- **Community Impacts**: Assessing how invasive crayfish affect native species and ecosystem function

## Current Primary Project

### Innovative Cover Crop Research

We are conducting cutting-edge research on the **role of cover crops in reducing nutrient loss** using a new experimental plot system featuring a novel cash cover crop approach. This comprehensive study examines multiple interconnected aspects:

**Soil & Water Quality**
- Soil nutrient content and quality assessments
- Porewater nitrogen concentration monitoring with and without cover crops
- Tile water nutrient loss quantification

**Ecological Interactions**  
- Weed species diversity and biomass comparisons between cover crop and reference plots
- Honeybee utilization patterns of cover crop flowers
- Plant-pollinator interaction networks

**Agricultural Sustainability**
- Economic viability of cash cover crops
- Integration with existing farming practices
- Long-term sustainability assessments

## Laboratory Facilities

Our research is supported by state-of-the-art facilities including water chemistry analysis equipment, greenhouse spaces for controlled experiments, and field monitoring stations throughout the Lake Superior region and upper Midwest watersheds.

## Collaborations

We work closely with:
- The Nature Conservancy on watershed management initiatives  
- Minnesota Pollution Control Agency
- Local farmers and agricultural organizations
- Other University of Minnesota departments and research centers
