# Welcome to my new webpage.![](images/perry.jpg){align="right" img="" border="2" style="PADDING-TOP: 5px" width="200" height="275"}

## The work we do in the laboratory covers two broad areas of research

1.  Bigeochemistry of streams, lakes, and tile-drained agricultural fields
    -   Watershed management effects on stream water quality
    -   Nitrate removal of constructed wetlands
    -   Cover crop reduction of nitrate losses
    -   Monitoring water quality in streams entering two drinking water reservoirs
2.  Crayfish ecology and invasions
    -   Invasion dynamics in streams
    -   Performance and behavior in flow
    -   Morphological differences in response to flow

**Sorry I am not taking graduate students until 2026**

My laboratory is currently working on one primary project:

1.  Role of cover crops in reducing nutrient loss from a new experimental plot system using a new cash cover crop.The aspects of this project we will be working on are:
    -   Soil quality and nutrient content
    -   porewater nitrogen concentrations with and without cover crops
    -   weed diversity and biomass associated with cover crops compared to reference
    -   honeybee use of the cover crop
    -   nutrient loss from tile water
