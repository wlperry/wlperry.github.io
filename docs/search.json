    "text": "Crayfish ecology\n As an aquatic biologist, I am interested in the factors affecting the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems with an emphasis on the effect of introduced species. Heavy commercial and recreational use of lakes and streams renders these systems subject to increasing numbers of introduced species both from other continents and from geographically distinct areas within North America. The introduction of exotic species introduced from other continents has received extensive attention from the media and government agencies. However, the homogenization of the native biota of the United States can have similar impacts on receiving ecosystems, but has received little attention. The United States has the highest biodiversity of freshwater mussels, crayfishes and fishes in the world. The introduction of exotic species is one of the major threats to this extensive biodiversity. I am currently studying the invasion of the rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) in northern Wisconsin and the local extinction of O. propinquus and O. virilis through ecological factors (competition and predation) and hybridization/introgression. I am also interested in many other aspects of aquatic biology including: herbivory, primary and secondary production, effects of pollution and habitat degradation, and the effects of top - down versus bottom-up control of food webs. If you have any question please email me or stop in the lab (416/417 Science Laboratory Building)."

Biogeochemistry of Freshwater Systems\nWe investigate the complex chemical and biological processes that govern water quality in streams, lakes, and tile-drained agricultural landscapes. Our current research includes:\n\nWatershed Management & Water Quality: Assessing how land management practices influence downstream water chemistry and ecosystem health\nConstructed Wetland Performance: Evaluating the effectiveness of engineered wetlands for nitrate removal from agricultural runoff\nCover Crop Efficacy: Quantifying how cover crops reduce nutrient losses from agricultural fields\nReservoir Water Quality Monitoring: Long-term monitoring of water quality in streams feeding drinking water reservoirs\n\n\n\n2. Crayfish Ecology & Invasion Biology\nOur crayfish research examines how native and invasive species interact with their environment and each other:\n\nStream Invasion Dynamics: Understanding how invasive crayfish species colonize and establish in new watersheds\nFlow Performance & Behavior: Investigating how water flow affects crayfish movement, feeding, and survival\nMorphological Adaptations: Documenting physical changes in crayfish populations in response to different flow regimes\nCommunity Impacts: Assessing how invasive crayfish affect native species and ecosystem function"
